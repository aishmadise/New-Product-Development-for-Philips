# New-Product-Development-for-Philips

The objective of this research is to introduce a new Philips coffee maker to the market by performing a segmentation analysis using the available conjoint study data and analyzing the predicted market share of the new coffee maker. We estimated mixture multinomial logit models to determine two unique segments, where each had different preferred attributes in a coffee maker. The smaller segment had no preference of brand but valued a 5-cup coffee maker with a water filter that is priced higher at $79. The larger segment of 74.1%, segment 1, prefers our brand of coffee maker, Philips, which is 15 cups with an auto-grinder (no water filter), priced at $59. After assessing the market potential of each segment’s ideal product and costs associated with developing multiple new products, it is in our best interest to introduce a coffee maker of segment 1’s preferred attributes, Product 6, while retaining the existing product, Product 5. This would allow us to increase the market share by 62.7% to 68.8% in segment 1, retain segment 2’s current market share of 33.6%, and boost our overall market share to 59.6% from 13.2%.
